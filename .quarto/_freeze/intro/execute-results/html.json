In other words, reliably better than chance! The experiment aimed to compare two methods in *Empirical Aesthetics*: the method of choice and the method of production. This choice experiment \"implies people know something about what makes a real Mondrian.\" In other words, we have an *intuition* of proportion and beauty.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" fig.asp='0.75' paged.print='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An *attempt* at a Mondrian using `ggplot2`](intro_files/figure-html/mondrian-fig-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Why Visualize? {-}\n\nData visualization plays numerous roles in the social sciences, from summarizing large amounts of information in a small space, to supporting claims about patterns and relationships among a vast array of indicators of human behavior. \n\nZinovyev [@zinovyev2010] identifies four types of visualizations in political science:\n\n> * *Statistical graphics and infographics* with extensive use of color, form, size, shape and style to superimpose many quantitative variables in the same chart or diagram\n* *Geographical information systems (GIS)* to visualize geographically-linked data\n* *Graph visualization or network maps* for representing relations between objects\n* Projection of multidimensional data on low-dimensional screens with further visualization, *data cartography*\n\nThroughout this book, we will cover examples of from all of these types of visuals.\n\n### About this Book {-}\n\nIf you are in the [Data Visualization](https://www.ibei.org/en/data-visualization_138263) course at IBEI, you will need it. If you are not, it might be useful anyway!\n\nTo keep things as simple as possible, the book follows this syntax:\n\n* `packages` are placed inside a shaded box (e.g. `ggplot2`),\n* common `functions()` are also inside a shaded box, and followed by parentheses (e.g. `mutate()` from `tidyverse` or `class()` from base R),\n* less common `functions()` are the same, but the package is explicitly called `::` (e.g. `reshape2::melt()`),\n* short R commands (e.g. `%in%`), are also shaded, non-R commands are in bold (e.g. **Ctrl + p**),\n* the common *pipe* operator `%>%` will be used when possible in the code^[For Windows users, the `%>%` shortcut in RStudio is **Ctrl + Shift + M** and for Mac users it is **Cmd + Shift + M**.] (i.e., we will mostly use the `tidyverse` syntax over base R).\n\n### Prerequisites {-}\n\nYou are not expected to have any familiarity with R at the beginning of the course, though some knowledge of statistics will be very helpful. We will cover the basics of working with R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) during the first few sessions. Some tutorial videos on the basics of working with RStudio are available [here]().
