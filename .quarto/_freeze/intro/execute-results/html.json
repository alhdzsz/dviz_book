This experiment \"implies people know something about what makes a real Mondrian.\" In other words, we have an *intuition* of proportion and beauty.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An *attempt* at a Mondrian using `ggplot2`](intro_files/figure-html/mondrian-fig-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most fun things about data visualization is making things that are beautiful. In making them, you learn a lot about not just the patterns you are displaying, but the scope and limitations of the underlying data. Having taught courses on data viz for several years, I have found that there is a correlation between the effort put into making a plot beautiful and how accurately it conveys the intended message. \n\n## Why Visualize? {.unnumbered}\n\nData visualization plays numerous roles in the social sciences, from summarizing large amounts of information in a small space, to supporting claims about patterns and relationships among a vast array of indicators of human behavior.\n\n@zinovyev2010 identifies four types of visualizations in political science:\n\n> -   *Statistical graphics and infographics* with extensive use of color, form, size, shape and style to superimpose many quantitative variables in the same chart or diagram\n> -   *Geographical information systems (GIS)* to visualize geographically-linked data\n> -   *Graph visualization or network maps* for representing relations between objects\n> -   Projection of multidimensional data on low-dimensional screens with further visualization, *data cartography*\n\nIn addition, visualization is often the last part of a data analysis pipeline. To visualize a data set you must first answer some questions:\n\n-   What do I want to visualize?\n-   Where can I get the data?\n-   How should my data set look like?\n-   What is the data telling me?\n\nIn other words, to create visualizations you must also know what data is (or not) out there (literature review), develop an intuition about what patterns you might find in it (research question/hypothesis), clean and wrangle lots of often messy data sets (methodology), create the visualization (results) and share it with your target audience (discussion). Think of the process as writing a small research paper. A single `.png` often speaks more than a thousand lines of code!\n\n### About this Book {.unnumbered}\n\nThe examples used throughout this book are closely related to corruption since that is one of my main areas of interest. This also allows me to explore different types of data that social scientists are likely to encounter such as surveys, text, networks, geo-locations, administrative records (*Big Data*), and regression models.\n\nAll used data is open source, though it often comes through APIs[^intro-2]. Sometimes, to access these data sets you need a *token* or *secret*. For obvious reasons, I will not share my own tokens here, but I will show you where the information you need should go in the code. When possible, I will also provide a clean version of the data used so you can experiment with it. \n\n[^intro-2]: API is short for *application programming interface* and it is a great way to get data directly from the source. Many data providers such as the World Bank offer APIs that connect directly to your R session.\n\nTo keep things as simple as possible, the book follows this syntax:\n\n-   `packages` are placed inside a shaded box (e.g. `ggplot2`),\n-   common `functions()` are also inside a shaded box, and followed by parentheses (e.g. `mutate()` from `tidyverse` or `class()` from base R),\n-   less common `functions()` are the same, but the package is explicitly called `::` (e.g. `reshape2::melt()`),\n-   short R commands (e.g. `%in%`), are also shaded, non-R commands are in bold (e.g. **Ctrl + p**),\n-   the common *pipe* operator `%>%` will be used when possible in the code[^intro-3] (i.e., we will mostly use the `tidyverse` syntax over base R).\n\n[^intro-3]: For Windows users, the `%>%` shortcut in RStudio is **Ctrl + Shift + M** and for Mac users it is **Cmd + Shift + M**.\n\n### Recommended Readings {.unnumbered}\n\nThis book does not expect a lot of familiarity with R or programming, though some knowledge of statistics will be very helpful. The appendix covers the basics of working with R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) during the first few sessions. Some tutorial videos on the basics of working with RStudio are available [here]().
