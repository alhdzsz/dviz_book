    "section": "Why Visualize?",
    "text": "Why Visualize?\nData visualization plays numerous roles in the social sciences, from summarizing large amounts of information in a small space, to supporting claims about patterns and relationships among a vast array of indicators of human behavior.\nZinovyev (Zinovyev 2010) identifies four types of visualizations in political science:\n\n\nStatistical graphics and infographics with extensive use of color, form, size, shape and style to superimpose many quantitative variables in the same chart or diagram\nGeographical information systems (GIS) to visualize geographically-linked data\nGraph visualization or network maps for representing relations between objects\nProjection of multidimensional data on low-dimensional screens with further visualization, data cartography\n\n\nThroughout this book, we will cover examples of from all of these types of visuals.\n\nAbout this Book\nIf you are in the Data Visualization course at IBEI, you will need it. If you are not, it might be useful anyway!\nTo keep things as simple as possible, the book follows this syntax:\n\npackages are placed inside a shaded box (e.g. ggplot2),\ncommon functions() are also inside a shaded box, and followed by parentheses (e.g. mutate() from tidyverse or class() from base R),\nless common functions() are the same, but the package is explicitly called :: (e.g. reshape2::melt()),\nshort R commands (e.g. %in%), are also shaded, non-R commands are in bold (e.g. Ctrl + p),\nthe common pipe operator %&gt;% will be used when possible in the code2 (i.e., we will mostly use the tidyverse syntax over base R).\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nYou are not expected to have any familiarity with R at the beginning of the course, though some knowledge of statistics will be very helpful. We will cover the basics of working with R and RStudio during the first few sessions. Some tutorial videos on the basics of working with RStudio are available here. Similarly, you may also consult the following open-source books on R:3\n\nR Cookbook (Long and Teetor 2019)\nR for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2016)\nR Graphics Cookbook (Chang 2018)\nEfficient R Programming (Gillespie and Lovelace 2016)\nHands-on Programming with R (Grolemund 2014)\nFundamentals of Data Visualization (Wilke 2019)\nText Mining with R (Silge and Robinson 2017)\nAn Introduction to R (Venables, Smith, and R Core Team 2021)\nR Markdown: The Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018)\nR Markdown Cookbook (Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nChang, Winston. 2018.
