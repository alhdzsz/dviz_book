# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book offers a gentle introduction to data visualization using R and -- occasionally -- python. In this book you will learn how to make beautiful, informative, and reproducible visualizations with examples from different social sciences. It is inspired by a course on Data Visualization that <a href="https://alhdzsz.net/" target="_blank">I</a> taught at the <a href="https://www.ibei.org/en" target="_blank">Barcelona Institute of International Studies</a>. Thus, a special thanks goes out to the many graduate students whose efforts, questions, and feedback helped greatly improve the content of this book!
